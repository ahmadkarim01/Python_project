# Exercise 2. Faulty Calculator:
# Design a calculator which will correctly 
# solve all the problems except the following ones:
# 45 * 3 = 555, 56 + 9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
# Your program should take operator and the two numbers as input from 
# the user and then return the result.

# a = int(input("Enter the two numbers: \n"))

# b = int(input())

x = 56
y = 9
if x+y == 65:
print(x+y)

# if inpu
#     print("Answer is false")
